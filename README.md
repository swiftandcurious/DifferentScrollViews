# DifferentScrollViews
This is a sample SwiftUI showcasing different types of scroll views. It’s designed for learning and sharing. 

## Features
- work with ScrollView – Creating both horizontal and paginated scrolling views.
- use a `HStack` and a `LazyHStack` and what is the difference, and embedding `ForEach` loop.
- work with models in Swift – Creating an Animal struct and leveraging `.map {}` for data transformation.
- create reusable views – Defining AnimalPhoto and using it dynamically for different data.
- use `GeometryReader` – Measuring screen width dynamically for layout adjustments.
- use `.scrollTargetBehavior(.viewAligned)` – Implementing a smooth snap effect for scroll views.
- create a TabView – Displaying multiple views with swipe-based navigation and tab bar items.
- apply a parallax effect using the `.scrollTransition` modifier and phase.value.
- use `.containerRelativeFrame(.horizontal)` to align each item with the scroll container’s bounds.
- use `.clipShape()` to mask overflow caused by scroll transitions.


## How to Run
